## Getting Started

### Requirements

- PHP 8.x with the `mysqli` extension
- MySQL or MariaDB
- Composer
- Node.js and npm (only to rebuild Tailwind CSS)

### Run locally with XAMPP

1. Clone the repository into your XAMPP `htdocs` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/envydoes/SumEste-Portal.git
   ```
2. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the XAMPP control panel.
4. Create a database in phpMyAdmin and import the SQL schema.
5. Set your database and email (SMTP) credentials in a `.env` file. Never commit this file.
6. Open `http://localhost/SumEste-Portal/` in your browser.

### Rebuild Tailwind CSS (optional)

```bash
npm install
npx tailwindcss -i ./tailwind/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

Adjust the input and output paths to match your setup.

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Security Notes

- Credentials live in environment variables or `.env`, never in committed code.
- `uploads/` contains resident ID images and must stay out of version control.
